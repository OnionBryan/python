A collection of experiments and scripts.

## Running the Network Simulation

1. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install torch matplotlib networkx
   ```
2. Execute the simulation:
   ```bash
   python run_simulation.py
   ```

The script will initialize a small network and display several plots demonstrating its dynamics.

## TensorFlow Setup Demo

A small script `tensorflow_setup.py` demonstrates initializing TensorFlow and running a matrix multiplication.

Run it with:
```bash
python tensorflow_setup.py
